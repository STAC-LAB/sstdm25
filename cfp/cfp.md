# IEEE ICDM 20th International Workshop on Spatial and Spatiotemporal Data Mining (SSTDM-2025)

*** Call for Papers ***

With advances in remote sensors, sensor networks, and the proliferation of location-sensing devices in daily life activities and common business practices, the generation of disparate, dynamic, and geographically distributed spatiotemporal data has exploded in recent years. Advances in ground, air-, and space-borne sensor technologies provide unprecedented access to Earth science data. However, the rapid generation of geospatial data exceeds our ability to analyze it effectively. This workshop explores Geospatial AI, Machine Learning, and Spatiotemporal Computing technologies to address challenges and offer innovative solutions for a range of problems, including climate change, sea-level rise, food, energy, water, natural disasters, and other critical issues.

Innovative, efficient, and explainable AI/ML techniques are needed to extract value from massive, complex geospatial data. Traditional methods fall short due to their failure to account for spatial and temporal complexities. We invite researchers and practitioners to submit original papers that explore new approaches, share insights, and address challenges in geospatial AI and spatiotemporal data mining.


*** Topics of interest include, but not limited to, the following: ***

* Theoretical foundations of geo-spatial-temporal DM, AI, ML, and DL
* Recent advances in Deep Learning for Spatial and Spatiotemporal Big Data
