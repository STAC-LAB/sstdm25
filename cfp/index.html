    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
    <p>
        With advances in remote sensors, sensor networks, and the proliferation of location-sensing devices in 
        daily life activities and common business practices, the generation of disparate, dynamic, and 
        geographically distributed spatiotemporal data has exploded in recent years. Advances in ground, 
        air-, and space-borne sensor technologies provide unprecedented access to Earth science data. 
        However, the rapid generation of geospatial data exceeds our ability to analyze it effectively. 
        This workshop explores Geospatial AI, Machine Learning, and Spatiotemporal Computing technologies 
        to address challenges and offer innovative solutions for a range of problems, including climate 
        change, sea-level rise, food, energy, water, natural disasters, and other critical issues.” 
    </p>
    <p>
        Innovative, efficient, and explainable AI/ML techniques are needed to extract value from massive, complex 
        geospatial data. Traditional methods fall short due to their failure to account for spatial 
        and temporal complexities. We invite researchers and practitioners to submit original papers 
        that explore new approaches, share insights, and address challenges in geospatial AI and 
        spatiotemporal data mining.
    </p>
